            <p>I was born and raised in North Kansas City, Missouri. I graduated from the University of Missouri at Kansas City with a 
                Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. After college, I worked with my father operating a small used car lot for 
                6 years. Then, I enjoyed working for a large financial services corporation for over 23 years as a mainframe software engineer and later as 
                a mainframe database administrator. I'm currently transforming my technical skills by participating in a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp
                at the University of Kansas - Edwards Campus.

                My wife and I have been married for 9 years and do not have any children. We enjoy raising our 3 Labrador Retrievers (two are UKC hunting retriever champions). 
            </p><br>
            <p>   
                My hobbies include: camping, hiking, canoeing, travel, bird hunting (with our dogs), snow skiing, off-roading, listening to music and binge watching TV shows or movies. 
                And on rare occasions, I enjoy customizing my old Corvette.
